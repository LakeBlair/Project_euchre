# Coding sample  
Name: Jiawei Hao  
Project: Euchre  
Project Partner: Casper Guo  

This project is about a card game called euchre. A famous card game in Michigan. This project adopted the C++ concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance. It uses class, derived class to represent abstract data like Player, Card, and Pack. The core idea of the project is to practice object oriented programming. The project is written with over two thousand lines of code with well designed unit testing.
