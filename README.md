Partner: Casper Guo
This project is about a card game called euchre. A card game famous in Michigan. This project adopted the concept of c++ object oriented programming. It uses complex class, derived class to represent abstract data like Player, Card, and Pack. The project is written with over two thousand lines of code with well designed unit testing. 

This repository's purpose is solely in use for demonstrating my coding samples for job application. Do not copy the code for any other use.
